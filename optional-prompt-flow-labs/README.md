# Optional Labs â€“ Prompt Flow

*Prompt Flow is a part of Hub-based Azure AI Foundry Project (which are Legacy now).*

*ðŸ‘‰ See the official guidance and migration details [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/migrate-project?tabs=azure-ai-foundry#overview).*

These labs are provided for reference and learning purposes only:
- You can still use Prompt Flow in existing projects.
- However, for new implementations we recommend choosing more future-proof approaches:
   - Copilot Studio for low-code agent building.
   - Copilot Studio + Azure services (AI Search, AI Foundry models, Function Apps, etc.) for extended scenarios.
   - Pro-code agent development when full customization and advanced orchestration are required.

Prompt Flow remains a useful skill to understand the evolution of Azure AI tooling, but it should not be the primary choice for strategic or long-term solutions.
