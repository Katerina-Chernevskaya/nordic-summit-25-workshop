## üß¨ Part 2: Fork and Clone the Workshop Repository

*Now let‚Äôs fork the repository and clone it locally so you can work with lab files in your own environment.*

- Create a folder on your laptop where you'll clone the repository. For example, you can create a folder named `nordic-summit-agent` on your C: drive.
1. Open the **GitHub repo** in your browser: [https://github.com/Katerina-Chernevskaya/nordic-summit-25-workshop](https://github.com/Katerina-Chernevskaya/nordic-summit-25-workshop)
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top right corner and create a copy in your own GitHub account.
3. In your forked repository, click the **Code** button and copy the **Clone URL** (HTTPS).

4. Open **PowerShell** or any terminal of your choice.
5. Navigate to a working directory where you want to clone the labs using `cd` command. For example:
   ```
   cd c:\nordic-summit-agent
   ```
6. Clone your forked repo (replace with the URL you copied before):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_CLONE_URL>
